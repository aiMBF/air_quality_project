# energy-consumption-project
 With rising concerns about energy efficiency and environmental impact, utility companies are increasingly collecting data on customer energy consumption. This project aims to develop a data analytics platform to gather, process, and analyze this data, helping to identify trends, detect consumption peaks, and optimize energy distribution.


## Steps
- Create an ETL pipeline to process large volumes of energy consumption data.
- Analyze consumption trends and provide actionable reports to support decision-making.
- Automate deployment of infrastructure and data pipelines on Google Cloud Platform.
